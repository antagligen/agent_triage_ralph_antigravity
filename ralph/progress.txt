# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
- Streamlit uses `st.session_state` to maintain state across reruns
- SSE streaming with `requests` requires `stream=True` and line-by-line parsing
- Docker Compose networks allow service-to-service communication by service name


## 2026-01-16 10:55 - US-001
- Implemented `README.md` with Architecture Diagrams.
- Files changed: `README.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Mermaid diagrams in READMEs provide excellent immediate context for new developers.
  - `docker-compose` instructions should always be at the top for quick starts.

## 2026-01-16 10:59 - US-002
- Implemented `backend/README.md` with API docs and Architecture overview.
- Files changed: `backend/README.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - Documenting the SSE stream format (thought vs routing) is critical for frontend integration.
  - Explicitly documenting how to extend the graph (add nodes) removes ambiguity for future agents.

## 2026-01-16 11:00 - US-003
- Implemented `frontend/README.md` documenting the Streamlit app.
- Files changed: `frontend/README.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - `st.status` is a great way to hide technical details like "thought chains" while keeping them accessible.
  - Documenting the SSE event types (`thought`, `routing`) helps clarify the protocol between frontend and backend.
