# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
- Streamlit uses `st.session_state` to maintain state across reruns
- SSE streaming with `requests` requires `stream=True` and line-by-line parsing
- Docker Compose networks allow service-to-service communication by service name

## 2026-01-16 - US-001
- Implemented BACKEND_URL standardization in frontend/app.py
- Updated docker-compose.yml to inject BACKEND_URL from service alias
- **Learnings:**
  - docker-compose environment variables override defaults in code
  - Explicit logging of configuration (like BACKEND_URL) drastically aids debugging in containerized envs
## 2026-01-16 - US-002
- Verified Docker Networking
- Fixed Backend crash due to invalid API Key by implementing MockChatModel
- Validated E2E connectivity via Browser and CLI
- **Learnings:**
  - ReAct agents require LLMs to support  ind_tools, even if mocked
  - Defaulting to a Mock Mode when keys are missing drastically improves DX for new contributors
## 2026-01-16 - US-003
- Implemented Frontend Connection Status Indicator with backend /health check
- Removed MockChatModel and dummy key logic from backend
- **Learnings:**
  - Streamlit sidebar re-renders on every interaction, making it a good place for status checks
  - Removing mocks ensures valid configuration is enforced early in the process
