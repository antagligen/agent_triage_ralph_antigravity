# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports


## 2026-01-15 20:46 - US-001
- Added `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `.env.example`
- Updated `AppConfig` to support `orchestrator_provider`
- Added tests for Gemini configuration default loading
- **Learnings:**
  - Pydantic's `Field(default=...)` is great for backward compatibility.
  - Using a provider enum/string helps distinguish between models even if the model name string is ambiguous.

## 2026-01-15 20:55 - US-002
- Implemented `llm_factory.py` with `get_llm`
- Updated `orchestrator.py` to use `get_llm`
- Added `langchain-google-genai` to requirements
- Verified with `test_llm_factory.py` and mypy
- **Learnings:**
  - `ChatOpenAI` and `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` behave slightly differently regarding API key validation during instantiation; need to mock keys for tests.
  - Adding `__init__.py` to `backend` was necessary for local pytest execution.

## 2026-01-15 21:05 - US-003
- Updated `ChatRequest` in `main.py` to accept `model_name` and `model_provider`.
- Modified `/chat` endpoint to override `AppConfig` dynamically.
- Refactored `aci.py` to use `get_llm` instead of hardcoded `ChatOpenAI`.
- Added `tests/test_model_override.py` verifying overrides propagate to the factory.
- **Learnings:**
  - `ChatOpenAI` validation triggers early; mocking `get_llm` everywhere is crucial for unit tests without API keys.
  - Sub-agents were direct-instantiating models, breaking the "Global Model Propagation" goal; refactoring them to use the factory fixes this.
  - `pathlib` is safer than `StaticFiles(directory="static")` when running from different CWDs.
