# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
- Streamlit uses `st.session_state` to maintain state across reruns
- SSE streaming with `requests` requires `stream=True` and line-by-line parsing
- Docker Compose networks allow service-to-service communication by service name

## 2026-01-15T21:40 - US-001 (Basic Streamlit App Scaffold)
- Created `frontend/app.py` with page config, header, and placeholder UI
- Created `frontend/Dockerfile` for Streamlit microservice
- Created `frontend/requirements.txt` with streamlit and requests
- Created `backend/Dockerfile` for FastAPI microservice
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with backend and frontend services
- **Learnings:**
  - Streamlit runs on port 8501 by default
  - Use `--server.headless true` for non-interactive mode
