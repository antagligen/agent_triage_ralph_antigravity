# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
- Streamlit uses `st.session_state` to maintain state across reruns
- SSE streaming with `requests` requires `stream=True` and line-by-line parsing
- Docker Compose networks allow service-to-service communication by service name

## 2026-01-15T21:40 - US-001 (Basic Streamlit App Scaffold)
- Created `frontend/app.py` with page config, header, and placeholder UI
- Created `frontend/Dockerfile` for Streamlit microservice
- Created `frontend/requirements.txt` with streamlit and requests
- Created `backend/Dockerfile` for FastAPI microservice
- Created `docker-compose.yml` with backend and frontend services
- **Learnings:**
  - Streamlit runs on port 8501 by default
  - Use `--server.headless true` for non-interactive mode

## 2026-01-15T21:46 - US-002 (Chat Input and History Display)
- Updated `frontend/app.py` with chat input and history functionality
- Added `init_session_state()` for `st.session_state.messages` initialization
- Added `render_chat_history()` using `st.chat_message` for user/assistant messages
- Added `handle_user_input()` to process and display messages immediately
- Moved system status to sidebar with `render_system_status()`
- **Learnings:**
  - `st.chat_input` always renders at the bottom of the page
  - `st.chat_message` uses "user" and "assistant" roles for different avatars
  - Session state persists across Streamlit reruns
