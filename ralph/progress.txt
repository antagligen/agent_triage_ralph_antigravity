## 2026-01-20 22:55 - US-001: Update streaming.py to use astream_events
- **What was implemented:**
  - Replaced `workflow.astream()` with `workflow.astream_events()` in `backend/src/streaming.py`
  - Added filtering for `on_chain_start`, `on_tool_start`, `on_chain_end` events
  - Each event now includes: node name, status, message, timestamp
  - Preserved backwards compatibility for `triage_report` and `routing` events
- **Files changed:**
  - `backend/src/streaming.py` - Complete rewrite to use astream_events API
  - `backend/tests/test_api_integration.py` - Updated test to mock astream_events instead of astream
- **Learnings:**
  - astream_events returns structured events with metadata containing `langgraph_node` for identifying which agent is running
  - Event structure: `{event, name, metadata, data}` where data contains input/output
  - Need to use `version="v2"` for astream_events to get proper event format

## 2026-01-20 23:18 - US-002: Standardize SSE event format for sub-agent thoughts
- **What was implemented:**
  - Backend already emits thought events with `{node, status, message, timestamp}` schema from US-001
  - Updated `frontend/app.py` to consume new thought event format using `message` field
  - Added status icons: 🔄 (chain_start), 🔧 (tool_start), ✅ (chain_end)
- **Files changed:**
  - `frontend/app.py` - Updated to handle standardized thought event schema with status icons
- **Verification:**
  - Tested with Gemini provider at localhost:8501
  - Confirmed thought events display with correct format and icons
  - Triage Report renders properly after thoughts
