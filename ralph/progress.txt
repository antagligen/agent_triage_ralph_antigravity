## 2026-01-15 - US-001
- Implemented FastAPI project structure
- Added Pydantic-based configuration loader (YAML/JSON)
- Created initial config.yaml with orchestrator and sub-agent definitions
- **Learnings:**
  - `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request.
  - Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file.
