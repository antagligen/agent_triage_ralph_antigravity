## 2026-01-21 18:34 - US-002: Update Session State for Tabs
- Session state schema already implemented in US-001 (`agent_tabs` dict with `{created, logs, status, has_new_activity}`)
- Added defensive check in `frontend/app.py` to prevent duplicate `tab_order` entries during rapid events
- Edge case handling verified: `.get()` used for missing agents, duplicate check for rapid events
- **Learnings:**
  - Session state management was mostly complete from US-001 scope
  - Defensive checks important for race conditions in streaming scenarios

## 2026-01-21 18:30 - US-001: Add Tab Container Component
- Implemented tab container using `st.tabs()` with dynamic sub-agent tabs
- Modified `frontend/app.py`:
  - Added session state for `agent_tabs` dict and `tab_order` list
  - Added tab container with Orchestrator as default tab
  - Dynamic tab creation when sub-agents are called
  - Events routed to correct tabs (sub-agent logs vs orchestrator thinking)
  - Updated Clear History to reset tab state
- **Learnings:**
  - Streamlit tabs must be created before the streaming loop
  - Tab order tracked separately from tab state for consistent display
