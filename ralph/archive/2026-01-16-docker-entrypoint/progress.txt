# Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
- Streamlit uses `st.session_state` to maintain state across reruns
- SSE streaming with `requests` requires `stream=True` and line-by-line parsing
- Docker Compose networks allow service-to-service communication by service name

## 2026-01-16 - US-002
- Configured Docker Compose secrets for backend and frontend
- Updated .gitignore to exclude secrets directory
- **Learnings:**
  - Docker Compose secrets are mounted at `/run/secrets/<secret_name>` by default
  - Local file-based secrets require the file to exist on the host before starting services
