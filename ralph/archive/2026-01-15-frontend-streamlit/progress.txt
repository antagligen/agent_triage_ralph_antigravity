## Codebase Patterns
- One Task = One Chat Session
- Always check out the correct branch before starting work
- `load_config` is cached with `@lru_cache` to avoid I/O on every request
- Pydantic models ensure strict typing for the configuration file
- `src` needs `__init__.py` for pytest to correctly resolve imports
